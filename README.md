Abstract
Glitters is a web-based application designed to minimize waiting times in stationery shops by allowing customers to pre-fill their purchase items, select their orders to the shop with the help of e-mail integration, and collect them when ready. By leveraging user-friendly web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and jQuery, Glitters provides a streamlined solution to common inefficiencies faced by customers and shop owners. This project emphasizes simplicity, practicality, and scalability to address a real-world problem. 

Introduction
Stationery shops often experience long queues, particularly during peak hours or exam seasons. This leads to frustration among customers and inefficiencies for shopkeepers. Glitters addresses these issues by digitizing a portion of the ordering process, enabling customers to specify their required items in advance. This ensures orders are prepared for quick pick-up, significantly improving the overall customer experience and shop operations.
The project reflects a modern approach to reducing physical waiting times by introducing digital solutions accessible to a wide range of users, thus encouraging the adoption of technology in small businesses.

 Motivation

These queues inconvenience customers and strain shop operations. Inspired by this, the project aims to create a simple yet effective system for improving customer service and operational efficiency.
Glitters emphasizes reducing stress for both customers and shopkeepers while fostering a smoother and more enjoyable shopping experience. The broader goal is to demonstrate how small-scale digitization can make a significant impact in daily life.
